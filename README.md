A game engine experiment

This is a simple framework I built mostly to help develop my (vanilla) Javascript skills. 
I don't really have any intension of making a REAL game using this tool. If I had those aspirations I would likely use Unity.

Its true in college I started out using plain old Javascript but, in the real world it's almost been exclusively jQuery.
